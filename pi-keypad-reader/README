This is code that reads input from a 4x3 numerical
membrane keypad matrix from a Rapsberry PI.
Details:
 - Keypad inputs are written to standard output. You can fork
   this from another process, and read a stream of keystrokes.
 - Keypad events are published in the form of UP and DOWN events.
 - Supports multiple key presses simultaneously.
 - Should work just as well with any other matrix keyboards, might
   need some customisation, though.
 - This is the product it has been tested on:
